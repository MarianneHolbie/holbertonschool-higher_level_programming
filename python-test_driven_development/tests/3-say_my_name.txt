 How to Use 3-say_my_name.py
===============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``say_my_name()``.

Strings
=======

``say_my_name()`` returns My name is <first name> <last name>.  

::

    >>> say_my_name =  __import__('3-say_my_name').say_my_name

    Now use it:

    >>> say_my_name("Ali", "Baba")
    My name is Ali Baba

Not Strings
=======

`if first_name and last_name are not string, function `say_my_name()`` raise a TypeError

::

    >>> say_my_name(123, "Baba")
    first_name must be a string

    >>> say_my_name("Ali", 2.8)
    last_name must be a string
