 How to Use 0-add_integer.py
===============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``add_integer()``.

Numbers
=======

``add_integer()`` returns the sum of its arguments.  

::

    >>> from 0-add_integer import add_integer
    >>> add_integer(2, 3)
    5

It also works with floating-point values if they are casted to integer.

::

    >>> my_function(2.0, 3)
    5

Non-Numbers
===========

Because it is only possible to add 2 numbers, a and b must be integers (or float).

::

    >>> my_function('a', 3)
    a must be an integer

    >>> my_function(6, 'b')
    a must be an integer
