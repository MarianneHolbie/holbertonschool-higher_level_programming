 How to Use 1-my_list.py
===============================

This module is very simple, since it only had one class inherance of list and one function called
``print_sorted()``.

``MyList``
============

::

    >>> MyList = __import__('1-my_list').MyList
   

Now use it (like a classic list with methods): 

::

    >>> numbers = MyList()
    >>> numbers
    []

    >>> numbers.append(3)
    >>> numbers
    [3]

    >>> numbers.append(12)
    >>> numbers.append(2)
    >>> numbers.append(25)
    >>> numbers.append(8)
    >>> numbers
    [3, 12, 2, 25, 8]


The class contains also a method called print_sorted: 
this method can return sorted list element without modification of initial list

    >>> numbers.print_sorted()
    [2, 3, 8, 12, 25]
